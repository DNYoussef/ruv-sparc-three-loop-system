# Mesh Topology Configuration
#
# Description: Peer-to-peer topology where all agents connect to each other.
# Best for: Collaborative tasks requiring consensus, distributed decision-making
# Complexity: O(n²) connections - use for 3-15 agents
# Fault Tolerance: High - no single point of failure

topology: mesh

# Maximum number of agents in the swarm
# Note: Mesh topology creates n*(n-1)/2 edges
# 5 agents = 10 connections
# 10 agents = 45 connections
maxAgents: 5

# Distribution strategy for workload allocation
# - balanced: Equal distribution across all agents
# - specialized: Agents take on specific roles
# - adaptive: Dynamic adjustment based on performance
strategy: balanced

# Optional: Consensus mechanism for collective decisions
# - byzantine: Byzantine fault tolerance (requires 3f+1 agents for f faults)
# - raft: Leader-based consensus (requires majority)
# - gossip: Epidemic protocol for eventual consistency
# - proof-of-learning: ML-based validation consensus
consensus: byzantine

# Optional: Agent capabilities (auto-assigned if not specified)
agentCapabilities:
  - research
  - coding
  - analysis
  - optimization
  - coordination

# Optional: Performance tuning
performance:
  # Minimum consensus threshold (0.67 = 67% agreement)
  consensusThreshold: 0.67

  # Maximum wait time for consensus (seconds)
  consensusTimeout: 30

  # Enable parallel task execution
  parallelExecution: true

  # Health check interval (seconds)
  healthCheckInterval: 10

# Optional: Memory configuration
memory:
  # Enable persistent cross-agent memory
  enabled: true

  # Memory retention layers
  retention:
    shortTerm: 24h    # 24 hours
    midTerm: 7d       # 7 days
    longTerm: 30d     # 30 days

# Optional: Monitoring and metrics
monitoring:
  enabled: true

  # Metrics to track
  metrics:
    - taskCompletion
    - consensusRate
    - agentUtilization
    - errorRate
    - responseTime
