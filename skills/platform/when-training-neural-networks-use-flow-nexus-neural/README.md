# Flow Nexus Neural Network Training - Quick Start

Train and deploy neural networks using Flow Nexus platform with distributed E2B sandboxes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Authenticate with Flow Nexus
mcp__flow-nexus__user_login

# 2. Initialize neural cluster
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_cluster_init {
  "name": "my-cluster",
  "architecture": "transformer"
}

# 3. Configure and train
# Edit neural/configs/architecture.json
# Run training script

# 4. Deploy
./neural/scripts/deploy.sh
```

## What This Skill Does

- **Setup:** Authenticate and initialize Flow Nexus neural training environment
- **Configure:** Design network architecture and deploy training nodes
- **Train:** Execute distributed training across cluster
- **Validate:** Run benchmarks and performance tests
- **Deploy:** Package and deploy to production with monitoring

## When to Use

- Training neural networks at scale
- Distributed training across multiple nodes
- Cloud-based ML model deployment
- Performance-critical inference needs
- Production ML pipelines

## Agents Involved

- **ml-developer**: Design architecture, optimize hyperparameters
- **flow-nexus-neural**: Coordinate distributed training
- **cicd-engineer**: Deploy and monitor in production

## Success Criteria

- Model accuracy â‰¥85%
- Inference latency <100ms
- Successful deployment
- Monitoring active

## Duration

45-90 minutes (depends on model complexity and dataset size)
