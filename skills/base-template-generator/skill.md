# Base Template Generator

Generate clean, production-ready foundational code templates for modern development frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when starting new projects that need solid foundational structure, creating consistent boilerplate across team projects, scaffolding microservices or API backends, or setting up frontend applications with modern tooling.

## Template Types

### Backend Templates
- Node.js with Express
- Python with FastAPI
- Go with standard library

### Frontend Templates
- React 18 with Vite
- Vue 3 Composition API
- Vanilla TypeScript

## Process

1. **Identify project type and requirements**
   - Determine framework and language
   - Identify essential features needed
   - Consider deployment target

2. **Generate foundational structure**
   - Create directory layout following best practices
   - Add package configuration (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod)
   - Include .gitignore and basic documentation

3. **Add essential tooling**
   - Linting configuration (ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint)
   - Testing framework setup
   - Build/dev scripts

4. **Include minimal dependencies**
   - Core framework only
   - Essential development tools
   - Avoid bloat from unnecessary packages

5. **Provide usage documentation**
   - README with quick start
   - Basic examples
   - Common commands

## Quality Standards

- Modern language/framework versions
- Security best practices
- No deprecated dependencies
- Clear, commented code
- Production-ready configuration
