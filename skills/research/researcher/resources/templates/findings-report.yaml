# Evidence-based recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate_actions:
    - priority: "high"
      recommendation: "Adopt transformer-based architecture for next project"
      rationale: "85% of SOTA papers use transformers (18/21 papers)"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Paper 1, Paper 2, Paper 3..."
      expected_impact: "10-15% performance improvement"

    - priority: "high"
      recommendation: "Implement reproducibility best practices"
      rationale: "Only 60% of papers provide code (12/20)"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Survey findings from 5 sources"
      expected_impact: "Increased credibility and citations"

  mid_term_goals:
    - priority: "medium"
      recommendation: "Explore few-shot learning approaches"
      rationale: "Emerging trend with 40% year-over-year growth"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Trend analysis from Papers with Code"
      timeline: "3-6 months"

  long_term_strategy:
    - priority: "low"
      recommendation: "Invest in multimodal capabilities"
      rationale: "Predicted to be dominant by 2025 (8 sources)"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Industry forecasts, academic surveys"
      timeline: "12+ months"
