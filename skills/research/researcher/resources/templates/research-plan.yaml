      - "At least 50% from Tier 1 sources"
      - "Publication dates within 5 years"
    pass_criteria: "All criteria met"

  checkpoint2_coverage:
    criteria:
      - "All primary objectives addressed"
      - "At least 3 sources per key topic"
      - "Contradictions identified and documented"
    pass_criteria: "All criteria met"

# Risk mitigation
risks:
  insufficient_sources:
    likelihood: "medium"
    impact: "high"
    mitigation: "Expand search to Tier 2 sources, extend timeline by 1 week"

  contradicting_evidence:
    likelihood: "medium"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Run knowledge-synthesizer.py for conflict resolution"

  scope_creep:
    likelihood: "low"
    impact: "high"
    mitigation: "Strict adherence to included/excluded scope, weekly reviews"

# Notes
notes:
  - "Use research-orchestrator.py for parallel API queries (faster)"
  - "Run sota-analyzer.js for Papers with Code integration"
  - "paper-summarizer.sh works best with properly formatted PDFs"
  - "knowledge-synthesizer.py requires scikit-learn for claim clustering"
