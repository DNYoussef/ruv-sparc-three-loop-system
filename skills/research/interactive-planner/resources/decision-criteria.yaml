# Example evaluation for common features
example_evaluations:
  - feature: "Real-time Collaboration"
    scores:
      "Development Time": 4  # 1-2 months - complex WebSocket implementation
      "Technical Complexity": 4  # Complex - conflict resolution, state sync

      "Technical Complexity": 2  # Simple - well-understood problem
      "User Impact": 4  # High - essential for many workflows
      "Business Value": 3  # Moderate - table stakes feature
      "Risk Level": 2  # Low - proven solutions available
    notes: |
      File upload is straightforward to implement and provides good value.
      Good candidate for early implementation.

  - feature: "Advanced Analytics Dashboard"
    scores:
      "Development Time": 3  # Moderate - 2-3 weeks
      "Technical Complexity": 3  # Moderate - data aggregation, visualization
      "User Impact": 3  # Moderate - useful but not critical
      "Business Value": 3  # Moderate - insights are valuable
      "Risk Level": 2  # Low - known techniques
    notes: |
      Analytics provides value but not essential for MVP.
      Could be deferred to post-MVP phase.

  - feature: "Two-Factor Authentication"
    scores:
      "Development Time": 2  # Fast - libraries available
      "Technical Complexity": 2  # Simple - standard implementation
      "User Impact": 3  # Moderate - security-conscious users care
      "Business Value": 4  # High - required for enterprise sales
      "Risk Level": 2  # Low - well-established patterns
    notes: |
      2FA is relatively easy to implement and critical for enterprise customers.
      High ROI for implementation effort.

# Recommended decision framework
decision_framework:

    description: "Features to implement first"
    criteria:
      - "User Impact >= 4 OR Business Value >= 4"
      - "Development Time <= 3"
      - "Risk Level <= 3"
    rationale: "High value, reasonable effort, manageable risk"

  medium_priority:
    description: "Features to consider for MVP or Phase 2"
    criteria:
      - "User Impact >= 3 OR Business Value >= 3"
      - "Development Time <= 4"
      - "Risk Level <= 4"
    rationale: "Good value, moderate effort/risk"

  low_priority:

    criteria:
      - "User Impact < 3 AND Business Value < 3"
      - "OR Development Time > 4"

# How to use this template:
usage_instructions: |
  1. Customize criteria weights based on your project priorities
     - Early startup? Emphasize speed and user impact
     - Enterprise? Emphasize business value and low risk
     - Technical product? Adjust technical complexity weight

  2. Score each feature across all criteria
     - Be honest and realistic
     - Use the scoring guide for consistency
     - Involve team in scoring for diverse perspectives

  3. Calculate weighted scores using decision-matrix.sh:
     ./decision-matrix.sh --criteria decision-criteria.yaml --options features.yaml --weights

  4. Review results and make informed decisions
     - High weighted score = good candidate for implementation
     - Low weighted score = defer or reconsider
     - Use decision framework for prioritization buckets

  5. Document rationale for each decision
     - Why was this prioritized or deprioritized?
     - What assumptions were made?
     - What would change the decision?
