# Agent Creation - Systematic Agent Design

Evidence-based agent creation following best practices for prompt engineering and agent specialization.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when creating new specialist agents for specific domains, refining existing agent capabilities, designing multi-agent coordination systems, or implementing role-based agent hierarchies.

## 4-Phase Agent Creation SOP

### Phase 1: Specification
- Define agent purpose and domain
- Identify core capabilities needed
- Determine input/output formats
- Specify quality criteria

### Phase 2: Prompt Engineering
- Apply evidence-based prompting principles
- Use Chain-of-Thought for reasoning tasks
- Implement few-shot learning with examples
- Define role and persona clearly

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Test with diverse inputs
- Validate output quality
- Measure performance metrics
- Iterate based on results

### Phase 4: Integration
- Define agent coordination protocols
- Establish communication patterns
- Configure memory and state management
- Deploy with monitoring

## Evidence-Based Prompting Principles

1. **Role Definition**: Clear agent identity and expertise
2. **Context Provision**: Relevant background information
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into steps
4. **Output Formatting**: Structured response templates
5. **Quality Constraints**: Explicit success criteria

## Agent Types

### Specialist Agents
- Domain-specific expertise (Python, React, SQL)
- Single responsibility principle
- Optimized for specific tasks

### Coordinator Agents
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Task delegation and routing
- Progress monitoring

### Hybrid Agents
- Multi-domain capabilities
- Adaptive role switching
- Complex workflow handling

## Integration

- **Claude Code**: Task tool for agent spawning
- **Claude-Flow**: Coordination topology setup
- **Memory-MCP**: Agent state persistence
