- Privacy by design

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- Protected Health Information (PHI) safeguards
- Administrative, physical, technical safeguards
- Business Associate Agreements (BAA)
- Audit controls and logging
- Breach notification

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
- Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)
- Control documentation
- Evidence collection
- Continuous monitoring
- Independent auditor reports

### PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- Cardholder data protection
- Network security controls
- Access control mechanisms
- Regular security testing
- Security policy maintenance

### ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)
- Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- Risk assessment and treatment
- 114 security controls across 14 domains

   - Identify data flows and storage
   - Assess current compliance gaps

2. **Implement controls**
   - Technical controls (encryption, access management)
   - Administrative controls (policies, procedures)
   - Physical controls (facility security)
   - Documentation and evidence

3. **Validate compliance**
   - Automated compliance scanning
   - Manual control testing
   - Evidence collection and review
   - Gap analysis and remediation

4. **Maintain compliance**
   - Continuous monitoring
   - Regular audits and assessments
   - Update controls for regulatory changes
   - Train personnel

5. **Prepare for audits**
   - Organize compliance documentation
   - Conduct pre-audit assessments
   - Engage external auditors
   - Implement findings

## Automated Compliance Checks

- **Access Control**: IAM policies, least privilege
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit
- **Logging**: Audit trails and monitoring
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, segmentation
- **Incident Response**: Breach notification procedures
