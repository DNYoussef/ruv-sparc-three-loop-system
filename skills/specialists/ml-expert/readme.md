# ML Expert - Machine Learning Implementation Specialist

**Status**: Gold Tier Skill
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Type**: Agent-based ML implementation skill with comprehensive resources

## Quick Start

This skill provides expert-level ML implementation capabilities through a specialist agent with deep PyTorch expertise. Use it for implementing architectures, fixing training issues, and optimizing model performance.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Implement new architecture
"Implement TRM × Titans-MAG with 25M parameters"

# Fix training issue
"Add diversity regularization to ACT head"

# Optimize performance
"Reduce inference time to <50ms"
```

## Triggers

Auto-activates on:
- "Implement [architecture/model]"
- "Fix training [issue]"
- "Optimize [metric]"
- "Build ML pipeline for..."
- "Add [feature] to model"
