# Sandbox Security Configuration - Quick Start

Configure Claude Code sandbox security with file system and network isolation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Assess requirements
Review sandbox-security/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md

# 2. Configure file isolation
./sandbox-security/config/configure-file-isolation.sh

# 3. Configure network isolation
./sandbox-security/config/configure-network-isolation.sh

# 4. Test security
./sandbox-security/tests/security-tests.sh

# 5. Deploy monitoring
./sandbox-security/monitoring/start-monitoring.sh
```
