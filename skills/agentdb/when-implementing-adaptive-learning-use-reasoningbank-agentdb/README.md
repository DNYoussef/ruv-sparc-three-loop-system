# ReasoningBank Adaptive Learning - Quick Start

Implement adaptive learning with ReasoningBank and AgentDB for trajectory tracking, verdict judgment, memory distillation, and pattern recognition.

## When to Use

- Build self-learning agents
- Optimize decision-making through experience
- Implement meta-cognitive systems
- Track and improve reasoning patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install reasoningbank-agentdb
npx ts-node setup-reasoningbank.ts
```

## 5-Phase Workflow

1. **Initialize ReasoningBank** (1-2 hrs) - Setup tracking system
2. **Track Trajectories** (2-3 hrs) - Record decisions and reasoning
3. **Judge Verdicts** (2-3 hrs) - Evaluate decision quality
4. **Distill Memory** (2-3 hrs) - Extract learned patterns
5. **Apply Learning** (1-2 hrs) - Improve future decisions

## Components

- **Trajectory Tracking**: Record decision paths
- **Verdict Judgment**: Evaluate outcomes
- **Memory Distillation**: Pattern extraction
- **Pattern Application**: Enhanced reasoning

## Success Metrics

- Tracking accuracy > 95%
- Verdict accuracy > 90%
- Decision quality improves
- 150x faster processing

## Agents

- **ml-developer**: System design
- **safla-neural**: Pattern learning
- **performance-analyzer**: Evaluation

## Duration

8-10 hours
