# AgentDB Reinforcement Learning Training - Quick Start

Train AI learning plugins with AgentDB's 9 reinforcement learning algorithms for building self-learning agents and optimizing agent behavior through experience.

## When to Use

- Train autonomous agents that learn from experience
- Implement Q-Learning, DQN, PPO, Actor-Critic, SAC, and more
- Build self-improving AI systems
- Deploy RL agents in production

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install agentdb-learning @agentdb/rl-algorithms
npx ts-node quickstart-rl.ts
```

## 5-Phase Workflow

1. **Initialize Learning Environment** (1-2 hrs) - Setup AgentDB, define environment
2. **Configure RL Algorithm** (1-2 hrs) - Select algorithm, set hyperparameters
3. **Train Agents** (3-4 hrs) - Execute training loop, monitor progress
4. **Validate Performance** (1-2 hrs) - Benchmark, compare with baseline
5. **Deploy Trained Agents** (1-2 hrs) - Export model, create API, monitor

## Available RL Algorithms

- Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN
- Actor-Critic, A2C, PPO
- TD3, SAC, Decision Transformer

## Success Metrics

- Reward curve stabilizes and improves
- Success rate > 80%
- Mean reward exceeds baseline by 50%
- Inference time < 10ms per action

## Agents Used

- **ml-developer**: Algorithm configuration and deployment
- **safla-neural**: Neural network training
- **performance-benchmarker**: Performance evaluation

## Estimated Duration

6-10 hours for complete implementation
