# VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Auto-checked by scripts/validate-intake.js)
# ==============================================================================

validation:
  required_fields_complete: false
  minimum_examples: false  # At least 3

# ==============================================================================
# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
# ==============================================================================

# HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
# 1. Copy this template to your skill directory
# 2. Fill in all "Required" sections (15 min)
# 3. Run: node scripts/validate-intake.js skill-name-intake.yaml
# 4. Fix any validation errors
# 5. Proceed to Phase 2 (Use Case Crystallization)

# QUICK TIPS:
# - Use concrete examples (not "format file" but "format src/index.js with Prettier")
# - Think about failure modes early (what could go wrong?)
# - Consider users who aren't familiar with the skill (clear trigger keywords)
# - Be specific about success criteria (how do you KNOW it worked?)

# TIME INVESTMENT: 5-10 minutes
# ROI: Prevents 30-60 minutes of rework later by catching requirements gaps early
