desired_outcome: "Code files are automatically formatted according to language-specific style guides, with clear feedback on changes made and proper error handling for edge cases."

  - "run prettier"
  - "run black"
  - "format file"
  - "apply code formatting"
  - "fix code style"

example_usage_1:
  scenario: "nominal_case"
  description: "Format a JavaScript file"

example_usage_2:
  scenario: "edge_case"
  description: "File has syntax errors"
  user_request: "Format main.py with syntax error"
  expected_behavior: "Detect syntax error, warn user, ask whether to fix or abort"
  expected_output: "Syntax error at line 15: unexpected indent. Fix syntax first? (y/n)"

example_usage_3:
  scenario: "error_case"
  description: "Formatter not installed"
  user_request: "Format app.rs but rustfmt not installed"
  expected_behavior: "Check for rustfmt, provide installation instructions if missing"

  - "Only supports text files (no binary formats)"
  - "Requires formatter tools installed (Prettier, Black, rustfmt)"
  - "Max file size: 10MB"
  - "Must preserve file encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16)"

must_have_features:
  - "Detect file language automatically from extension"
  - "Use appropriate formatter per language"
  - "Provide clear success/error feedback"
  - "Check formatter availability before running"

nice_to_have_features:
  - "Support custom formatter configuration files"
  - "Batch format entire directories"

success_criteria:
  - "File formatted according to language style guide (verified by formatter --check)"
  - "User receives clear feedback on number of lines changed"
  - "Syntax errors detected and reported before formatting"
  - "Original file preserved if formatting fails"

failure_conditions:
  - "File corrupted or lost"
  - "Silent failure (no error message)"
  - "Wrong formatter used for file type"
  - "Formatter hangs indefinitely (no timeout)"
