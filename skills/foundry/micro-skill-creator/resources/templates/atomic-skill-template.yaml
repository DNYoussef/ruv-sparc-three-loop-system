# ===========================
# METHODOLOGY TEMPLATE
# ===========================
methodology:
  # Select appropriate pattern based on task type

  # PATTERN 1: Self-Consistency (for factual/extraction tasks)
  self_consistency:
    steps:
      - "Extract information from multiple perspectives"
      - "Cross-reference findings for consistency"
      - "Flag any inconsistencies or ambiguities"
      - "Provide confidence scores"
      - "Return validated results"

  # PATTERN 2: Program-of-Thought (for analytical/logical tasks)
  program_of_thought:
    steps:
      - "Decompose problem into logical components"
      - "Work through each component systematically"
      - "Show intermediate reasoning"
      - "Validate logical consistency"
      - "Synthesize final analysis"

  # PATTERN 3: Plan-and-Solve (for complex/multi-step tasks)
  plan_and_solve:
    steps:
      - "Create comprehensive plan with dependencies"
      - "Break into executable steps"
      - "Execute plan systematically"
      - "Validate completion at each step"
      - "Return complete solution"

# ===========================
# FAILURE MODES
# ===========================
failure_modes:
  # Document known failure modes and handling strategies

  ambiguous_input:
    detection: How to detect this failure
    mitigation: How to handle or prevent
    fallback: What to do if mitigation fails

  insufficient_data:
    detection: Detection criteria
    mitigation: Request additional information
    fallback: Return partial results with warnings

  validation_failure:
    detection: Output doesn't meet quality standards
    mitigation: Retry with refined approach
    fallback: Flag for human review

# ===========================
# VALIDATION RULES
# ===========================
validation:
  input:
    - rule: Input must match schema
    - rule: Required fields must be present
    - rule: Type validation for all fields

  processing:
    - rule: Methodology must be followed
    - rule: Intermediate results validated
    - rule: Error handling applied

  output:
    - rule: Output matches contract
    - rule: Quality standards met
    - rule: Metadata complete

# ===========================
# TEST CASES
# ===========================
test_cases:
  - name: Normal Operation
    input:
      field_name: valid_value

    expected_output:
      status: failed
      error:
        type: validation_error
        message: specific_error_message
