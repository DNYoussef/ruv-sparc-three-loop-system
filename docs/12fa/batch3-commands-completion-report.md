## Diagram Characteristics

### Design Patterns Applied
- **Dark theme**: Professional #0a0e1a background
- **Color-coded workflows**: By phase and function
- **Orthogonal splines**: Clean, professional routing
- **Comprehensive legends**: Consistent visual language
- **Feedback loops**: Error handling and retry logic shown

### Key Features Visualized
1. **Parallel Execution**: 8.3x speedup optimization workflows
2. **Neural Learning**: Pattern training and continuous improvement
3. **Session Management**: Complete lifecycle from pre-task to post-task
4. **SPARC Extended**: 16 specialized SPARC methodology workflows
5. **TDD Workflow**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle with validation gates
6. **Swarm Coordination**: Multi-agent orchestration patterns
7. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live visualization and streaming data

### Color Coding Legend
- **Orange (#d97706)**: Command triggers
- **Blue (#2563eb)**: Primary workflows and analysis
- **Green (#10b981)**: Success paths and optimization
- **Red (#dc2626)**: Error states and TDD "Red" phase
- **Bright Green (#16a34a)**: TDD "Green" phase (passing tests)
- **Amber (#f59e0b)**: Warnings and refactoring
- **Purple (#7c3aed)**: Memory, MCP tools, and coordination

## Technical Notes

### Diagram Structure
Each diagram follows this pattern:
1. **Command Trigger** - Entry point with parsing
2. **Processing Phases** - 3-5 workflow stages
3. **Validation Gates** - Quality and completeness checks
4. **Output Generation** - Results and reports
5. **Feedback Loops** - Error handling and retry logic
6. **Legend** - Visual reference for colors

### Naming Conventions
- File: `{command-name}-process.dot`
- Graph: `{command_name}_command`
- Clusters: `cluster_{category}`
- Nodes: `{descriptive_name}` (snake_case)

### Color Palette
Designed for readability and professional presentation:
- Background: #0a0e1a (dark blue-black)
- Text: #ffffff (white)
- Edges: #4a90e2 (bright blue)
- Fills: Category-specific (see legend above)
