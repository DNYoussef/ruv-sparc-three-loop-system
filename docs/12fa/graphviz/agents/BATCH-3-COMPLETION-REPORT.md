## Technical Specifications

### Workflow Patterns Used

1. **Sequential Workflows**: Linear progression through phases
   - codex-auto-agent, codex-reasoning-agent, gemini-search-agent
   - goal-planner, code-goal-planner
   - business-analyst, market-researcher, product-manager

   - root-cause-analyzer (7 agents)
   - swarm-pr (5 reviewers)
   - swarm-issue (4 analyzers)
   - release-swarm (4 preparers)
   - multi-model-orchestrator (3 models)

3. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous improvement
   - safla-neural (learning loop)
   - topology-optimizer (continuous optimization)
   - performance-monitor (real-time updates)
   - sync-coordinator (re-sync if needed)

4. **Conditional Branching**: Decision points
   - multi-model-orchestrator (model selection)
   - sync-coordinator (auto vs manual resolution)
   - load-balancer (health-based routing)
   - topology-optimizer (topology selection)

### Layout Types

## Rendering Instructions

To render any diagram to PNG/SVG:

```bash
# PNG rendering
dot -Tpng agents/codex-auto-agent-process.dot -o output/codex-auto-agent-process.png

# SVG rendering (scalable)
dot -Tsvg agents/codex-auto-agent-process.dot -o output/codex-auto-agent-process.svg

# Batch render all Batch 3 diagrams
for file in agents/*-process.dot; do
  name=$(basename "$file" .dot)
  dot -Tpng "$file" -o "output/${name}.png"
  dot -Tsvg "$file" -o "output/${name}.svg"
done
```
