## Major Deviations from Plan

### Deviation 1: No Acquisition Plan Exists

**Expected**: 6-week acquisition readiness plan with milestones
**Actual**: No acquisition documentation found anywhere
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Cannot assess acquisition progress without baseline

**Files Searched** (All returned NOT FOUND):
- `ACQUISITION_READINESS_STATUS.md` (user reference)
- `6-WEEK-PLAN.md`
- `REVENUE-METRICS.md`
- `MRR-TRACKING.md`
- `ACQUIRE-COM-LISTING.md`

**Root Cause**: Project never had acquisition goals defined

---

### Deviation 2: Zero Revenue Focus

**Expected** (If acquisition plan existed):
- Week 1: Initial customers
- Week 2: Pricing model finalized
- Week 3: $100-500 MRR
- Week 4: $500-1000 MRR
- Week 5: $1000+ MRR

**Actual**:
- Week 1-5: $0 MRR
- No pricing model
- No customer acquisition
- No revenue tracking
- No monetization strategy

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Unprofitable product not attractive for acquisition
**Gap**: 100% - Zero revenue vs any meaningful MRR

---

### Deviation 3: Technical Debt Focus Instead of Market Validation

**Expected** (If acquisition plan existed):
- Customer interviews
- Market validation
- Competitive analysis
- Demo preparation
- Sales funnel creation

**Actual**:
- Internal code quality improvements
- NASA compliance enforcement
- God object refactoring
- Test coverage improvements
- Technical documentation

**Impact**: HIGH - Strong technical foundation but no market validation
**Gap**: 100% - Zero customer-facing work

---

### Deviation 4: Week 5 Completely Missing

**Expected**: Acquire.com listing, buyer engagement
**Actual**: No Week 5 documentation exists
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Lost week with no progress toward goals

**Evidence**:
```bash
find docs -name "*WEEK-5*"
# Result: 0 files found

grep -r "Week 5" docs/*.md
# Result: Only references in other weeks' "Next Steps" sections
```

**Root Cause**: Likely Week 5 never started or was abandoned
