ACTUAL CODE COVERAGE MEASUREMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================================================================

Date: 2025-11-13
Tool: pytest-cov 4.1.0 with coverage.py 7.11.0
Test Suite: tests/test_unified_coordinator.py

====================================================================
HEADLINE NUMBERS
====================================================================

OVERALL LINE COVERAGE:     73.71% (254/343 statements)
OVERALL BRANCH COVERAGE:   71.88% (46/64 branches)
TARGET LINE COVERAGE:      80%
STATUS:                    Below target by 6.29%

ALL TESTS PASSING:         25/25 (100%)
EXECUTION TIME:            6.62 seconds

====================================================================
COMPARISON TO CLAIMED COVERAGE
====================================================================

Week 4 Documentation Claim:    90.2%
Actual Measured Coverage:       73.71%
Discrepancy:                    -16.49 percentage points

VERDICT: The 90.2% claim appears to be estimated/documentation-based.
         The 73.71% is REAL coverage from pytest-cov measurements.

====================================================================
COMPONENT BREAKDOWN
====================================================================

CacheManager:         60.27% | Branch: 65.00% | Status: BELOW TARGET
StreamProcessor:      70.83% | Branch: 100.00% | Status: BELOW TARGET
MetricsCollector:     61.36% | Branch: 57.14% | Status: BELOW TARGET
ReportGenerator:      61.11% | Branch: 75.00% | Status: BELOW TARGET
UnifiedCoordinator:   78.79% | Branch: 85.71% | Status: CLOSE TO TARGET

====================================================================
UNCOVERED FUNCTIONALITY
====================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Core Features):
  - CacheManager.warm_cache (0%) - Cache warming
  - StreamProcessor streaming lifecycle (0%) - Real-time analysis
  - MetricsCollector.create_snapshot (0%) - Metrics snapshots
  - ReportGenerator.generate_all_formats (0%) - Multi-format reports

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Utilities):
  - CacheManager performance metrics (0%)
  - UnifiedCoordinator dashboard methods (0%)
  - Report export functionality (0%)

LOW PRIORITY (Helpers):
  - Internal helper methods (0%)
  - Severity normalization (0%)

====================================================================
PATH TO 80% COVERAGE
====================================================================

QUICK WINS (+3-4%):
  1. Add tests for ReportGenerator.generate_all_formats (10 statements)
  2. Add tests for CacheManager.warm_cache (8 statements)
  3. Add tests for MetricsCollector.create_snapshot (4 statements)

MEDIUM EFFORT (+2-3%):
  1. Test StreamProcessor lifecycle methods (7 statements)
  2. Test CacheManager performance methods (4 statements)
  3. Test UnifiedCoordinator dashboard (4 statements)

TOTAL EFFORT:
  - 15-20 additional test cases
  - 4-6 hours of work
  - Would achieve ~80-82% coverage

QUALITY ASSESSMENT
====================================================================

STRENGTHS:
  + All 25 tests passing (100% success rate)
  + Branch coverage exceeds 70% target (71.88%)
  + Core functionality well-covered
  + StreamProcessor has perfect branch coverage (100%)

WEAKNESSES:
  - Line coverage below 80% target (73.71%)
  - Many utility methods untested (0%)
  - Streaming features not tested
  - Cache warming logic untested

OVERALL GRADE: B+ (Good foundation, needs improvement)

====================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
====================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE: Add tests for high-priority uncovered methods
2. SHORT-TERM: Test streaming lifecycle and cache warming
3. MEDIUM-TERM: Achieve 80%+ coverage across all components
4. LONG-TERM: Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows

====================================================================
NOTES
====================================================================

This report contains ACTUAL measured coverage from pytest-cov,
not estimated or documentation-based coverage percentages.

All numbers are reproducible by running:
  pytest tests/test_unified_coordinator.py --cov=analyzer/architecture --cov-report=term-missing --cov-branch

Branch coverage is enabled and measures decision point coverage,
providing a more rigorous assessment than line coverage alone.
