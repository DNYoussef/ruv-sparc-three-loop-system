## Key Features and Innovations

### 1. **Correct Naming Convention Applied**
✅ **Pattern for Agents**: `{role}-{specialization}` (simple, reusable)
✅ **Pattern for Skills**: `{action}-{domain}-when-{trigger}` (trigger-based, workflow)

**Agent Name**: `marketing-specialist` (WHO it is)
**Skill Names** (WHEN to use): Would be like `orchestrate-product-launch-when-releasing-new-product`

**Benefits**:
- Agents are reusable across many contexts
- Skills show triggers and orchestrate multiple agents
- Clear separation between specialists (agents) and workflows (skills)

### 2. **Complete Command Integration from MECE Inventory**

**Universal Commands** (from inventory):
- `/file-write`, `/memory-store`, `/agent-delegate` (as specified)
- Plus full set of file, git, communication, memory, testing commands

**Specialist Commands** (from inventory + domain research):
- `/campaign-create` - Initialize campaigns with strategy framework
- `/audience-segment` - Analyze and segment target audiences
- `/ab-test-setup` - Configure A/B tests
- `/funnel-analyze` - Analyze marketing funnel performance
- Plus 6 additional specialist commands for comprehensive coverage

### 3. **MCP Tool Integration from MECE Inventory**

**Exactly as specified in inventory**:
- `mcp__ruv-swarm__agent_spawn` - For campaign sub-agents ✅
- `mcp__flow-nexus__workflow_create` - For campaign workflows ✅
- `mcp__claude-flow__memory_store` - For campaign data ✅
- `mcp__ruv-swarm__neural_train` - For learning from campaigns ✅

Plus additional MCP tools for comprehensive coordination.

### 4. **Evidence-Based Prompting Techniques**

**Self-Consistency Checking**:
- Verifies campaign strategies from multiple analytical perspectives
- Cross-validates recommendations before finalizing
- Ensures alignment with business objectives and past performance

**Program-of-Thought Decomposition**:
- Breaks complex campaigns into systematic sub-goals
- Identifies dependencies before execution
- Evaluates alternative approaches

**Plan-and-Solve Framework**:
- Explicit planning phase before execution
- Validation gates at each stage
- Iterative optimization with continuous monitoring

### 5. **Comprehensive Failure Mode Prevention**

**8 Documented Failure Modes**:
1. Poor Audience Targeting (symptoms, prevention, recovery)
2. Inconsistent Brand Messaging (causes, solutions)
3. Inadequate Testing Before Launch (pre-launch checklist)
4. Ignoring Data and Analytics (data-driven practices)
5. Over-Reliance on Single Channel (diversification)
6. Budget Misallocation (reallocation strategies)
7. Creative Fatigue (refresh protocols)
8. Attribution Confusion (multi-touch models)

Each includes:
- Symptom identification

```javascript
await mcp__ruv-swarm__agent_spawn({
  type: "orchestrate-marketing-campaigns-when-need-audience-growth",
  capabilities: [
    "campaign-planning",
    "audience-segmentation",
    "multi-channel-execution",
    "performance-analytics"
  ]
});
```

**Method 3: Claude Agent SDK (TypeScript)**
```typescript
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

for await (const message of query('Launch product marketing campaign', {
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
  systemPrompt: marketingSpecialistPrompt,
  permissionMode: 'acceptEdits',
  allowedTools: ['Read', 'Write', 'WebFetch', 'Bash']
})) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

**Method 4: Claude Agent SDK (Python)**
```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query
import asyncio

async def run_marketing_agent():
    async for message in query(
        'Create retention campaign',
        model='claude-sonnet-4-5',
        system_prompt=marketing_specialist_prompt,
        permission_mode='plan'
    ):
        print(message)

asyncio.run(run_marketing_agent())
```

### Integration with SOP Workflows

**Used in**: `sop-product-launch` (10-week workflow)

**Phase Integration**:
- **Week 1-2**: Research & Planning (works with Market Researcher, Business Analyst)
- **Week 7-8**: Marketing & Sales Prep (coordinates with Sales Specialist, Content Creator)
- **Week 9-10**: Launch Execution & Monitoring (works with Performance Monitor, Support)

**Memory Coordination**:
```javascript
// Marketing Specialist stores campaign data
marketing/product-launch-2025-q2/strategy
marketing/product-launch-2025-q2/audience-segments
marketing/product-launch-2025-q2/performance-metrics

// Other agents retrieve for coordination
sales/lead-qualification-criteria  // Sales Specialist reads marketing data
product/target-segments  // Product Manager aligns with marketing
support/retention-campaigns  // Support uses campaign insights
```
