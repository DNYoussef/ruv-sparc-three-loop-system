## Appendix: Validation Methodology

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Readiness Score = (Documentation × 0.25) +
                  (Examples × 0.20) +
                  (Integration × 0.25) +
                  (Safety × 0.15) +
                  (Maintainability × 0.15)
```

**Thresholds**:
- 9-10: Production-ready (exemplary) ✅
- 8-9: Production-ready (approved) ✅
- 7-8: Conditional (minor enhancements needed) ⚠️
- <7: Rejected (critical issues) ❌

**Result**: All 12 skills scored 8-10, with 4 achieving exemplary status (10/10).
