ACTION ITEMS (PRIORITY ORDER)
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Next CLAUDE.md Update):

      These are frequently used development workflows
  [ ] Create "Cloud & Infrastructure" section with 3 skills
  [ ] Add dogfooding-system to self-improvement section
  [ ] Add 4 specialist collection skills

SHORT TERM (This Sprint):
  [ ] Audit 94 invalid references in CLAUDE.md
  [ ] Clarify agents vs. skills distinction
  [ ] Check status of 51 completely missing specialist skills
  [ ] Organize parent directories (cloud-platforms, infrastructure, etc.)

LONG TERM (Next Quarter):
  [ ] Create missing specialist skills (aws-specialist, kubernetes-specialist, etc.)
  [ ] Create missing coordinator agents (if needed)
  [ ] Standardize naming conventions across skills and agents
  [ ] Consolidate skill hierarchy

INTERPRETATION NOTES
================================================================================

1. "When-*" Skills:
   - These are conditional/contextual trigger paths
   - Base skills (pair-programming, etc.) are documented
   - But the "when-*" variants in filesystem are NOT documented
   - These need to be added to trigger patterns

2. Collection/Parent Skills:
   - cloud-platforms, infrastructure, observability, etc.
   - May be directories containing sub-skills
   - Need clarification on whether they're standalone skills or coordinators

3. Invalid References:
   - 43 are agents (coder, tester, reviewer, etc.) - should be in Agent section, not Skill section
   - 51 are truly missing (need creation or removal from documentation)

4. Coverage Calculation:
   - 91 correct out of 111 filesystem skills = 81%
   - Adding 20 missing would reach 100%
   - Need to handle 94 invalid references separately
