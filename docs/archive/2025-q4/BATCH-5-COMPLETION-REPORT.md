## 💾 MEMORY MCP STORAGE

All 35 agents stored in Memory MCP with complete metadata:

**Storage Pattern**:
```javascript
mcp__memory-mcp__memory_store({
  text: "Agent #{number}: {name} - Production-Ready v2.0\n\nCORE IDENTITY: ...",
  metadata: {
    key: "batch-5-agents/{agent-name}/metadata",
    namespace: "agents",
    layer: "long_term",  // 30+ day retention
    category: "agent-metadata",
    project: "ruv-sparc-three-loop-system",
    agent: "{agent-name}",
    intent: "documentation"
  }
})
```

**Benefits**:
- Cross-session persistence
- Vector search retrieval for similar agents
- Complete agent specifications available to all agents
- WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tagging for audit trails
