TIER 2: RECOMMENDED (75-85% confidence)
  ✅ FastAPI WebSocket - Real-time (45-50k connections, CVE PATCHED)
  ✅ DayPilot         - Calendar (React 19 support, WCAG manual impl required)
  ✅ Jotai            - Performance state (fine-grained reactivity)

TIER 3: AVOID (100% consensus)
  ❌ react-beautiful-dnd - DEPRECATED (archived Aug 2025)
  ❌ Recoil           - DISCONTINUED (Meta stopped development)
  ❌ 'zustand.js'     - MALICIOUS (typosquatting package)

================================================================================
CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

[Priority 1] IMMEDIATE - Update FastAPI
  ⚠️  CVE-2024-47874: Starlette DoS (CVSS 8.7) - PATCHED
  Action: pip install --upgrade fastapi starlette
  Deadline: Before any deployment

[Priority 2] BEFORE INSTALL - Verify Zustand Package
  ⚠️  Typosquatting: Malicious 'zustand.js' package exists
  Action: Install 'zustand' NOT 'zustand.js'
  Mitigation: Use package-lock.json

[Priority 3] BEFORE PRODUCTION - WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
  ⚠️  Legal: ADA, Section 508, EN 301 549, EAA 2025
  Action: DayPilot keyboard nav + screen reader (manual)
         dnd-kit testing with axe-core (built-in compliance)
         Test with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
  Deadline: Before production launch

[Priority 4] BEFORE API DEPLOYMENT - OWASP Authorization
  ⚠️  Risk: 40% of API attacks target BOLA
  Action: OAuth2PasswordBearer on ALL FastAPI endpoints
  Standard: OWASP API Security Top 10 2023

[Priority 5] BEFORE CONTAINERS - Docker Secrets
  ⚠️  Standard: NIST SP 800-190 critical requirement
  Action: Docker Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager
  Never: Embed plaintext secrets in Dockerfile

  [PLANNED]    WebSocket scaling (Redis Pub/Sub for 10k+)
  [MONITOR]    DayPilot community (have fallback plan)

LOW (1):
  [MONITOR]    React 19 compatibility (DayPilot confirmed, test others)
