# Decision Matrix - Path Selection for Acquisition Readiness
**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Purpose**: Compare 3 strategic paths to determine optimal approach
**Status**: DECISION REQUIRED
**Audience**: Project stakeholders, decision makers

---

## Executive Decision Summary

**Question**: Should we pursue immediate acquisition (Path 1-2) or build market validation first (Path 3)?

**Recommendation**: **Path 3: Technical Excellence → Market Validation → Acquisition**

**Why**: Highest probability of success (50% vs 5-40%), realistic timeline (12 weeks), leverages existing strengths (proven technical foundation), reduces risk (validate market before committing to acquisition).

**Trade-off**: Delays acquisition by 7-10 weeks BUT increases valuation potential ($500K-$750K vs $400K-$600K) and buyer confidence (proven revenue vs zero revenue).

**Decision Point**: Choose path based on urgency vs. success probability.

| **Success Probability** | 60% (trust-building) | 40% (high effort, uncertain ROI) | 50% (proven revenue) |
| **Risk Level** | LOW | MEDIUM | MEDIUM-LOW |
| **Revenue Required** | $0 (no revenue) | $500-1000 MRR | $500-1000 MRR |
| **Customers Required** | 0 (pre-revenue) | 3-5 paying | 5-10 paying |
| **Test Coverage** | 9% (documented honestly) | 60%+ (validated) | 20-30% (core paths) |
| **Claims Validation** | Honest about gaps | Every claim verified | Critical claims only |

## Decision Framework: Path Selection Flowchart

```
START: How urgent is acquisition?

├─ URGENT (Need exit in <2 weeks)
│  └─ Can you accept $400K-$600K valuation?
│     ├─ YES → Path 1: Honest Positioning
│     └─ NO → RECONSIDER: Low urgency options may be better
│
├─ MEDIUM URGENCY (6-8 weeks acceptable)
│  └─ Can you invest 240-400 hours?
│     ├─ YES → Are you confident in customer acquisition?
│     │  ├─ YES → Path 2: Full Validation
│     │  └─ NO → Path 3: Technical Excellence First
│     └─ NO → Path 1: Honest Positioning OR Path 3: Technical Excellence First
│
└─ LOW URGENCY (10-12 weeks acceptable)
   └─ Want to maximize success probability?
      ├─ YES → Path 3: Technical Excellence First (RECOMMENDED)
      └─ NO → Path 1: Honest Positioning (if time-constrained)
```

- Success Probability: 60%
- **Expected Value: $500K × 60% = $300K**
- Time Investment: 40-60 hours
- **EV per Hour: $300K ÷ 50 hours = $6,000/hour**

**Path 2: Full Validation**
- Valuation: $750K-$1M (midpoint: $875K)
- Success Probability: 40%
- **Expected Value: $875K × 40% = $350K**
