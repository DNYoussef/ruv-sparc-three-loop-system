## 🎯 The Core Innovation

This plugin demonstrates a **reusable architectural pattern** for building composable AI development systems:

```
Skills (as SOPs)
    ↓
Specialized Agents (86+ with explicit SOPs)
    ↓
Slash Commands (ergonomic access)
    ↓
MCP Integration (coordination & state)
    ↓
Complete Integration Mappings
```

**What makes this different?**

- **Skills as Standard Operating Procedures**: Each skill is a complete, explicit workflow with step-by-step instructions
- **Agent Registry with SOPs**: 86+ specialized agents, each with defined capabilities, prompting techniques, and skill mappings
- **Evidence-Based Prompting**: Self-consistency, Byzantine consensus (2/3, 4/5, 5/7), Raft consensus, Program-of-thought
- **Complete Integration Layer**: Full documentation mapping skills → agents → commands → MCP tools
- **META-SKILL Architecture**: Skills that dynamically compile agent+skill execution graphs
- **Composability**: Mix and match agents, skills, and coordination patterns for any workflow

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Method 1: Direct from GitHub (Recommended)
/plugin install ruv-sparc-three-loop-system@github

# Method 2: Clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/DNYoussef/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system.git
cd ruv-sparc-three-loop-system
/plugin install .
```

### MCP Server Setup

The plugin includes MCP configurations that are automatically applied.

**Required** (installed automatically):
- **claude-flow**: Agent coordination and swarm management

**Optional** (install separately for enhanced features):
```bash
# Enhanced coordination, neural features, DAA
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start

# Cloud features, sandboxes, templates
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start
# Note: Flow Nexus requires registration: npx flow-nexus@latest register
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# In Claude Code
"List skills from ruv-sparc-three-loop-system"
/sparc:tutorial
"Show me the agent registry"
```

## 📖 How to Use the Architecture

### Pattern 1: Use Existing Skills

```
"Execute the code-review-assistant skill for PR #123"
```

The skill automatically:
1. Spawns appropriate agents (reviewer, security-analyst, performance-analyzer)
2. Each agent follows its explicit SOP
3. Agents coordinate via MCP tools
4. Results synthesized with consensus mechanisms

### Pattern 2: Compose Custom Workflows

```
"Create a custom workflow:
1. Use researcher agent to analyze requirements
2. Use system-architect agent to design solution
3. Use coder agent with TDD approach to implement
4. Use theater-detection-audit to validate
5. Use production-validator to check deployment readiness"
```

Each agent executes its SOP, coordinating through the integration layer.

### Pattern 3: Build New Skills from Agents

```
"Create a new skill called 'api-development-workflow' that:
- Uses the specification agent to document API contracts
- Uses backend-dev agent to implement endpoints
- Uses tester agent to create integration tests
- Uses api-docs agent to generate OpenAPI specs
- Uses production-validator to check readiness"
```

The skill becomes reusable, with explicit agent assignments.

### Pattern 4: Execute Complete Workflows

```
"Execute the complete Three-Loop System for:
Build a user authentication system with JWT, OAuth2, and RBAC"
```

This runs the full research → implementation → testing → deployment cycle.

## 🔧 Advanced: The META-SKILL Pattern

The most powerful pattern is the **META-SKILL**: a skill that dynamically creates agent+skill execution graphs.

**How it works** (Loop 2 example):

1. **Analyzes** input (requirements, plans, context)
2. **Selects** optimal agents from 86-agent registry per task
3. **Assigns** skills to agents (when skills exist) OR generates custom instructions
4. **Creates** agent+skill assignment matrix
5. **Executes** dynamically with continuous monitoring
6. **Validates** with theater detection and reality checks

This allows **project-specific adaptation** while maintaining **explicit SOP structure**.

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Byzantine Consensus for Reliability

Multi-layer fault-tolerant consensus:
- **Analysis**: 5/7 agreement (root cause analysis)
- **Validation**: 4/5 agreement (theater detection)
- **Pre-mortem**: 2/3 agreement (risk severity assessment)

### 2. Theater Detection & Reality Validation

6-agent validation with Byzantine consensus (4/5) to eliminate fake implementations:
- Sandbox execution verification
- Output validation
- Integration testing
- Edge case verification
- Performance benchmarking

### 3. Cross-Layer Learning

Failures and successes feed back through the integration layer:
- Failure patterns from testing → planning improvements
- Successful patterns → new skills and agent SOPs
- Performance metrics → agent selection optimization

### 4. Complete Observability

Full integration mapping means you can always see:
- Which agents are executing
- Which skills they're using
- Which MCP tools are coordinating
- Which consensus mechanisms are validating
- Real-time progress and bottlenecks

## 📊 Architecture Comparison

## 🎯 Example Workflows

### SPARC Development Workflow

```bash
/sparc "Implement real-time chat with WebSocket and Redis"
```

Executes: specification → pseudocode → architecture → refinement → completion
Uses: 6+ specialized agents with Byzantine consensus validation

### Code Review with Multi-Agent Consensus

```bash
"Run code-review-assistant on PR #123"
```

Spawns specialized reviewers:
- Security analyst
- Performance analyzer
- Style checker
- Test coverage validator
- Documentation reviewer

Results synthesized with majority consensus.

### Custom Agent Composition

```
"Use these agents in sequence:
1. intent-analyzer: Understand what user really needs
2. researcher: Find best practices and patterns
3. system-architect: Design optimal solution
4. coder: Implement with TDD
5. theater-detection-audit: Validate everything works
6. production-validator: Check deployment readiness"
```

Each agent follows its explicit SOP, coordinating through integration layer.
