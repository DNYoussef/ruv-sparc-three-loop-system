/plugin install ruv-sparc-three-loop-system@github

# Or manually clone to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/DNYoussef/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system.git ~/claude-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system

# Then in Claude Code:
/plugin install ~/claude-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system
```

### Method 2: Clone and Install Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DNYoussef/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system.git
cd ruv-sparc-three-loop-system

# The plugin will be automatically detected by Claude Code
# if it's in a trusted directory or added to your project
```

### MCP Server Setup

The plugin includes MCP server configurations in `.mcp.json`. These will be automatically configured when you install the plugin.

**Required MCP Server** (installed automatically):

**Optional MCP Servers** (install separately for enhanced features):

```bash
# ruv-swarm (enhanced coordination, neural features, DAA)
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start

# Flow Nexus (cloud features, sandboxes, templates, Queen Seraphina)
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start
# Note: Flow Nexus requires registration: npx flow-nexus@latest register
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# In Claude Code, check available skills:
"List skills from ruv-sparc-three-loop-system"

# Test with a slash command:
/sparc:tutorial

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Agent Registry

Edit `agents/registry.json` to customize agent configurations:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "researcher": {
      "type": "core-development",
      "capabilities": ["web-research", "github-analysis", "synthesis"],
      "skills": ["research-patterns", "evidence-collection"],
      "description": "Research specialist for gathering and synthesizing information"
    }
  }
}
```

### Skill Mappings

See `docs/SKILL-AGENT-MAPPINGS.md` for complete mappings between skills, agents, and MCP tools.

### MCP Server Setup

Configure in `mcp-servers/`:
- `claude-flow.json` (required) - Agent coordination
- `ruv-swarm.json` (optional) - Enhanced swarm features
- `flow-nexus.json` (optional) - Cloud features, neural AI, sandboxes

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### META-SKILL Architecture (Loop 2)

The parallel-swarm-implementation is a META-SKILL that acts as a "swarm compiler":

1. **Analyzes** Loop 1 planning package
2. **Selects** optimal agents from 86-agent registry per task
3. **Assigns** skills to agents (when skills exist) OR generates custom instructions
4. **Creates** agent+skill assignment matrix
5. **Executes** dynamically with continuous monitoring

This allows true project-specific adaptation while maintaining explicit SOP structure.

### Byzantine Consensus

Multi-layer fault-tolerant consensus:
- **Analysis**: 5/7 agreement (root causes)
- **Validation**: 4/5 agreement (theater detection)
- **Pre-mortem**: 2/3 agreement (risk severity)

### Cross-Loop Learning

Loop 3 generates failure patterns that feed back to Loop 1 for continuous improvement:
- Failure categorization (null-safety, type-mismatch, async-handling, etc.)
- Prevention strategies
- Pre-mortem questions
- Architectural recommendations
